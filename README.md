# QUD-dataset
Qatar university dataset (QUD) is an open access repository, which includes micro-moments power consumption footprints of different appliances. It is collected at Qatar university energy lab.  In the initial version of QUD, power usage footprints have been gathered for a period of more than 3 months until now. The collection campaign is still ongoing in order to cover a period of one year and other appliances.

QUD is an annotated dataset devoted for anomaly detection in power consumption. Five micro moment classes are defined, in which the first three ones represent normal consumption: “class 0: good usage”, “class 1: turn on”, and “class 2: turn off”. 
On the other hand, “class 3: excessive power consumption” and “class 4: consumption when outside” describe anomalous consumption.

Those wishing to use the dataset/codes in academic works should cite this our papers as the references.  QUD.csv: this file includes the energy consumption footprints (collected during the measurement campaign) and corresponding microm-moments labels, check the metada file for more details. DRED.csv: includes a sample of energy consumption from the DRED dataset which has been labeled using micro-moments. SimDataset: represents a simulated dataset that has been generated and labeled using the micro-moment paradigm.
