# QUD-dataset
Qatar university dataset (QUD) is an open access repository, which includes micro-moments power consumption footprints of different appliances. It is collected at Qatar university energy lab.  In the initial version of QUD, power usage footprints have been gathered for a period of more than 3 months until now. The collection campaign is still ongoing in order to cover a period of one year and other appliances.

QUD is an annotated dataset devoted for anomaly detection in power consumption. Five micro moment classes are defined, in which the first three ones represent normal consumption: “class 0: good usage”, “class 1: turn on”, and “class 2: turn off”. 
On the other hand, “class 3: excessive power consumption” and “class 4: consumption when outside” describe anomalous consumption.

Those wishing to use the dataset in academic work should cite this paper as the reference.  QUD_app-1.csv: this file includes the different kinds of data collected during the measurement campaign: Column 1: Date Column 2: Time Column 3: appID Column 4: occupancy pattern Column 5: Power consumption Column 6: Normalized power Column 7: Quantified power Column 8: Micro-moment class
